# ALTRGRPC
ALTR Technical Challenge

Hello,

I had fun implementing this technical challenge. I learned quite a bit while doing it. I believe I have implemented user stories 1 and 2 with the gRPC service and gRPC client.
I honestly did not have time to fully cover my code with unit tests so there's barely any unit tests written. Apologies for that. 

In this tech challenge, I implemented the gRPC service using the Repository design pattern with Entity Framework using an In Memory Database. The database being used to check for
past requests with the same IP Address within the last 30 seconds. I also had to learn what an exponential backoff was, and I believe I implemented that to the best of my ability.

I hope to hear from you guys soon

Thanks,
Gianlouie Molinary
